Books,Books,9780072262582,The ROI Story: A Guide for IT Leaders,"Disruptive IT infrastructure has been the norm over the decades, rather than the exception. Still, we have never seen a time such as now. The traditional hardware-defined datacenter model is besieged on multiple fronts. On one side is the public cloud, which continues to grow ever more popular. On the other side is software-defined infrastructure known as hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI), which is also growing extremely rapidly. Seemingly sandwiched in the middle is the hybrid combination of software-defined infrastructure on-premises with multiple public cloud options – known as multi-cloud.\\nDisruptive infrastructure technology such as hyper-converged tends to significantly complicate the buying decision. It forces new operational procedures and can impact IT governance, security, and compliance. It alters buying cycles and can conflict with traditional infrastructure budgeting. It may eliminate IT staffing positions. To achieve approval, this kind of disruption often necessitates extensive financial justification. But even favorable economics might not be enough to alter the ingrained processes, interests, and cultural norms surrounding the legacy environment. In many cases, it takes an ROI story.\\nThe goal of this book is to assist CIOs, CTOs, CFOs, IT managers, IT staff, channel partners, manufacturers, consultants, cloud providers, systems integrators, outsourcers, and anyone else interested in how to use financial analysis as a framework to optimize strategic decision-making. It is geared toward evaluating and building a corresponding business case for disruptive infrastructure technologies, and focuses on Nutanix’s HCI-based solution, what we call enterprise cloud, though the methodologies should prove helpful for analyzing any platform.",Book partner,9780072262582,9.99,97
